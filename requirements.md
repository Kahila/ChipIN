## Requirements

* required to implement a practical project that will demonstrate your proficiency with data structures discussed during this course (especially the Graph ADT) using the theme discussed below.

* The mini project demonstrates your understanding and proficiency with the concepts discussed in class and how they can be applied within a specific domain to solve a problem. You might need to make use of data structures we have not yet covered in class. In this case you will need to research the implementation of the appropriate data structure. The practical mini project must meet the following requirements:

    * Programming Language: Java
    * Submitted File Format: Zip (Only!)
    * Submitted File Naming Convention: studentnumber miniproject.zip
    * The ZIP file must contain the following directory structure:
        * src – that contains all of the Java source files.
        * dist – that contains a executable jar file.
        * ss – that contains PowerPoint or PDF Slideshow for your Mini Project.
    * The use of third-party libraries for primary functionally is strictly prohibited, however, third party libraries can be used for othe functionality such as communications and visualisation (such as normal JavaFX, JFreeChart, GraphStream, JGraphT, Yworks, JUNG or JMonkey).
    * Your assignment must be executable from a jar file. If the assignment cannot be executed, you will receive zero.
    * Your assignment must make use of a graph-based structure at its core.
    * The use of other data structures for auxiliary operations is encouraged (List, Stack, Queue, Heap, Dictionary, Trees, etc.).
    * You must write the data structures yourself, you may use the textbook to guide you in the implementation of your data structures.
    * You may not do a practical implementation that has already been assigned during the course.
    * The assignment is an individual project and should not overlap with any other students (past or present) or source code found on the Internet. Each assignment will be checked and if found guilty will be sent up for disciplinary action.

## Theme: Blockchains with Graphs

* The theme for the Mini Project are network-based Blockchains. A blockchain is a collection of
records (called blocks), where each block links to the previous block using cryptography. Each
block contains cryptographic hash, timestamp and data relevant to its application. Think of
it as a distributed ledger where instead of information being stored in a database it is stored
on the blockchain. Some examples of solutions that use a blockchain at its core are:

    1. Cryptocurrencies (however, for this project you may NOT do a cryptocurrency)
    2. Smart contracts
    3. Trading
    4. Supply chain management
    5. Anti-counterfeiting
    6. Healthcare
    7. Domain names
    8. Proof of existence
    9. Voting
    10. and many others!
